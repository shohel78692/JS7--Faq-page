		<h2>How would you spend your time? <i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-down"></i></h2>
		<div class="answer">I enjoy spending my time in a variety of ways, but my priorities usually involve self-improvement, pursuing my passions, and helping others. In my free time, I like to read books, practice meditation or yoga, or take courses online to expand my knowledge and skills.</div>

    <div class="faq">
		<h2>Where do you see yourself in five years?  <i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-down"></i></h2>
		<div class="answer">Well, in five years I see myself living in a giant mansion with a pet unicorn and a personal chef who only cooks mac and cheese. I'll be an international spy, saving the world from evil villains and taking frequent breaks to enjoy my personal chocolate fountain. Or maybe I'll have finally achieved my lifelong dream of becoming a professional napper, getting paid to sleep all day. The sky's the limit, really!</div>

    <div class="faq">
		<h2>Do you have any nicknames?  <i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-down"></i></h2>
		<div class="answer">Oh, I've had so many nicknames over the years, it's hard to keep track. My mom used to call me 'Sweetie Pie,' but that was before I became a ruthless business tycoon. Now my colleagues call me 'The Shark,' because I always get what I want. Or maybe you could call me 'The Sultan of Sass' - it has a nice ring to it, don't you think?</div>
